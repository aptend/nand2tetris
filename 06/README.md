# Lessons

Assembler can be written by any high-level language

## Symbol resolution
- Variables: map to some address, the actual values are insignificant
- Labels: assigned to specific instruction address

1. Address space reserved for instruction should be dynamic, at least larger?
2. One command may generate more than one variable, assembler needs to track them.
3. Assembler must consider various data types' requirements for number of register
